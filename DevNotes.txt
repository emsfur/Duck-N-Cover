Started off making the art for the game, map took way longer than it should've.

Got the player sprite and animations from here: https://duckhive.itch.io/ducky-old
which I really loved

Once I had some assets, I created the unity 2D template and imported the assets. For now,
the player will just be a freezeframe placeholder sliding around.

When working with pixel art and importing it as png, it may be blurry by default. Along 
with that scaling it up looks scuffed. That can be fixed on the image asset by:
	- make sure the texture type is Sprite (2D and UI)
	- change filter mode to Point (no filter)
	- Change compression to None

I decided to just jump straight into multiplayer movement rather than testing first... and 
it wasn't so bad. A good chunk of it is based on https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3yuBOB3VrCk
	- Import Netcode and Multiplayer Tools
	- Create NetworkManager as an empty gameobject
	- Add the NetworkManager script to it (under Netcode assets)
	- Set protocol type to unity transport

To get a player working, it's gotta be a prefab with network object script on it
	- Hierarchy will have no player, server/host will handle that
	- Add the prefab to NetworkManager on both PlayerPrefab and Network Prefabs

For movement (legacy rn), I started with client side movement with unity transport script on player.
This works for host but not other clients. The issue with this is it's server authorative, so clients
try to move but server snaps em back.

TESTING: gotta build and run to test as seperate instances
	- feel like it could be done using cmd but need to check later
